Stagecraft Session Manager
==========================

Stagecraft Session Manager is a user-friendly web-based session manager for Linux multimedia applications. It aims to bring the simplicity of the familiar and intuitive workflow of music hardware (such as keyboard workstations) to the powerful platform Linux audio.

Rather than reinventing the wheel, SSM uses existing technologies and packages them together into an seamless interface.

- NSM
- aj-snapshot
- node.js

Here are some ways Stagecraft Session Manager improves on existing session management solutions:

##Complete session control through a web browser
No need to mess with your laptop every time you play a new song. Easily change songs on stage using a smartphone or tablet

##Global Setup
Configure your hardware, global apps (such as MIDI filters, OSC routers, mixers), and audio/MIDI routing between them in a global space, seperate from each song. 

This is similar to Studios in LADISH, but is a much more simple and stable solution

##App Templates
Add new components to your session through a using predefined app templates. Templates currently exist for the following apps:

- Drum Machine            (Hydrogen)
- Arpeggiator             (Qmidiarp)
- MIDI Groove Sequencer   (Non-Sequencer)
- MIDI Timeline Sequencer (Libre Octave Studio)
- All apps that support NSM Directly
